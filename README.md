# Zodiac-340-Transposition-Reverser
This repository contains a small program, that allows to reverse the used transposition cipher, which the Zodiac Killer used in his Z-430 message.

To reverse the substitution (after the transposition), you can use AZDecrypt (from van Eycke) or you can use our CrypTool 2

-> CrypTool 2: https://www.cryptool.org/de/ct2/downloads

For details, have a look at David Oranchak's video about breaking the cipher: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1oQLPRE21o
Also, I made a video about breaking the first block of the cipher to verify their solution: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIrOftXgibg

Kind regards,
